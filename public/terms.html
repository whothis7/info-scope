    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <p>Welcome to our platform. By creating an account, accessing, or using any part of the service, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully.</p>

    <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
    <p>By creating an account or using our service, you are confirming that you have read and agreed to these Terms of Service. You acknowledge that any changes to these terms will become immediately effective upon posting and that continued use of the service constitutes acceptance of any revised terms.</p>

    <h2>2. Account Responsibility</h2>
    <p>You are solely responsible for the security of your account. We strongly recommend that you use a strong, unique password for your account, which will be stored securely using industry-standard encryption methods. We are not responsible for any unauthorized access to your account that occurs as a result of weak or shared passwords, or lack of proper safeguards.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Privacy and Encryption</h2>
    <p>All personal information, including passwords, will be stored using encryption methods to ensure data security. We take reasonable measures to protect your personal data, but we cannot guarantee absolute security. You acknowledge and accept that there are inherent risks associated with the transmission of personal information online.</p>

    <h2>4. Prohibited Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to exploit, abuse, or misuse the service in any way, including but not limited to:
        <ul>
            <li>Attempting to breach the security of the platform or its users.</li>
            <li>Using automated systems (bots, scrapers) to access the service without permission.</li>
            <li>Sharing your account credentials with others.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>5. Modifications to the Service</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of the service at any time without notice. You agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the service.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to the Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update these Terms of Service at any time. Any changes will become effective immediately upon posting. Your continued use of the service after any changes to the terms will be considered acceptance of those changes.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>We are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from your use of the service, including but not limited to:
        <ul>
            <li>Loss of data.</li>
            <li>Service interruptions.</li>
            <li>Unauthorized access to your account.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>9. Password and Account Responsibility</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for securely storing your account credentials, including your password. At this time, we do not offer the ability to change your password after account creation. Therefore, it is important that you choose a strong password and store it securely. If you lose your login credentials, you may lose access to your account as we cannot reset or modify passwords at this time.</p>
